  """Like ``jit``, but partitions ``fun`` across multiple devices.

  WARNING: this feature is still under active development! It may not work well,
  and may change without warning!

  `sharded_jit` sets up ``fun`` for just-in-time compilation with XLA, but
  unlike ``jit``, the compiled function will run across multiple devices
  (e.g. multiple GPUs or multiple TPU cores). This is achieved by spatially
  partitioning the data that flows through the computation, so each operation is
  run across all devices and each device runs only a shard of the full
  data. (Some data can optionally be replicated, which is sometimes more
  efficient for small arrays when combined with larger spatially-partitioned
  arrays.) Communication between devices is automatically inserted as necessary.

  ``sharded_jit`` can be useful if the jitted version of ``fun`` would not fit
  in a single device's memory, or to speed up ``fun`` by running each operation
  in parallel across multiple devices.

  Note: ``sharded_jit`` is currently available on TPU only!

  Args:
    fun: Function to be jitted.
    in_parts: The input partitions, i.e. how each argument to ``fun`` should be
      partitioned or replicated. This should be a PartitionSpec indicating into
      how many partitions each dimension should be sharded, None indicating
      replication, or (nested) standard Python containers thereof. For example,
      ``in_parts=PartitionSpec(2,1)`` means all arguments should be partitioned
      over two devices across the first dimension;
      ``in_parts=(PartitionSpec(2,2), PartitionSpec(4,1), None)`` means the
      first argument should be partitioned over four devices by splitting the
      first two dimensions in half, the second argument should be partitioned
      over the four devices across the first dimension, and the third argument
      is replicated across the four devices. All PartitionSpecs in a given
      ``sharded_jit`` call must correspond to the same total number of
      partitions, i.e. the product of all PartitionSpecs must be equal.
    out_parts: The output partitions, i.e. how each output of ``fun`` should be
      partitioned or replicated. This follows the same convention as
     ``in_parts``.
    num_partitions: Optional. If set, explicitly specifies the number of devices
      ``fun`` should partitioned across (rather than inferring it from
      ``in_parts``, ``out_parts``, and/or any ``with_sharding_constraint``
      calls).  Setting this should usually be unnecessary, but can be used to
      maintain device persistence across multiple sharded_jit calls when some of
      those calls only involve replicated values.

  Returns:
    A version of ``fun`` that will be distributed across multiple devices.

  WARNING: this feature is still under active development! It may not work well,

  This should only be called inside a function transformed by ``sharded_jit``.
  It constrains how the function is sharded: regardless of any other specified
  partitions, the compiler will make sure that ``x`` is sharded according to
  ``partitions``.  Note that a ``with_sharding_constraint`` call doesn't
  necessarily correspond to a reshard, since the compiler is free to achieve
  this sharding as long as the constraint is met, e.g. it might insert a reshard
  earlier in the computation. Another way to think of this is that the
  ``with_sharding_constraint`` call may flow "up" the function to preceding
  operations as well as "down" to subsequent ones.

  ``partitions`` must correspond to the same number of total partitions dictated
  by the outer ``sharded_jit`` and any other ``with_sharding_constraint`` calls.
  In the case where only replication has been specified, any ``partitions`` are
  valid.

  Example usage:
    @partial(sharded_jit, in_parts=None, out_parts=None, num_shards=2
    def f(x):
      y = x + 1
      y = with_sharding_constraint(y, PartitionSpec(2,1))
      return y * 2

  In this example, the inputs and outputs of ``f`` will be replicated, but the
  inner value of ``y`` will be partitioned in half. ``f`` will run on two
  devices due to the with_sharding_constraint call.

  Args:
    x: Array value
    partitions: PartitionSpec indicating how ``x`` should be partitioned, or
      None for replication.

  Returns:
    A new version of ``x`` with the specified sharding applied.
