# This script installs TFP test dependencies using pip, and does some sanity
# checks beforehand to make sure things look like they should work. Namely:
#   1. Make sure a virtualenv is active, unless user has explicitly asked not
#      to (by passing the --user flag to this script).
#   2. Make sure no invalid tensorflow packages are already installed:
#      a. no non-nightly versions (i.e. the stable `tensorflow` pip package)
#      b. if a nightly version is present, it is consistent with the presence
#         or absence of the --enable_gpu flag.
#
# Simple usage (from the root of the TFP repo, with a virtualenv active):
#
# ```bash
#   $ ./testing/install_python_packages.sh
# ```
#
# Usage outside of a virtualenv (not recommended):
#
# ```bash
#   $ ./testing/install_python_packages.sh --user
# ```
#
# The --user variant will simply forward the --user flag to pip install
# commands, telling pip to install the dependencies in the user install
# directory.
