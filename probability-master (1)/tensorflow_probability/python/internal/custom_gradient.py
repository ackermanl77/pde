  TF only supports VJPs, so we decorate with tf.custom_gradient.

  JAX supports either JVP or VJP. If a custom JVP is provided, then JAX can
  transpose to derive a VJP rule. Therefore we prefer jvp_fn if given, but fall
  back to the vjp functions otherwise.

  Args:
    vjp_fwd: A function (*args) => (output, auxiliaries).
    vjp_bwd: A function (auxiliaries, output_gradient) => args_gradients.
    jvp_fn: A function (primals, tangents) => (primal_out, tangent_out).

  Returns:
    A decorator to be applied to a function f(*args) => output.
