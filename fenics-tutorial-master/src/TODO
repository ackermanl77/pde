[x] Need to add instructions for how to send feedback and report typos
    https://github.com/hplgit/fenics-tutorial
[x] Remaining poisson_function --> poisson_solver
[x] Why CamelCase for BoxField? It's a Python module, so better name
    it boxfield? Yes AL will fix.
[x] """Comment""" in functions even if just one line?
[x] Move Python codes for vol1 to vol1/python, the rest to vol2/python
[x] Needed to use $\text{Lam\'e's}$ to trick doconce spellchecker
[x] Needed to uncomment line \usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc} in latex.py
    when using Springer_sv to fix Norwegian and Swedish characters
    in preface
[x] Fix UTF-8 issues in preface
[x] Check the `dolfin_parameters.xml` file if it still works
[x] Manage to compile everything using make.sh (only 'make' works for me)
[x] There are still some unfortunate page breaks. I will ignore these
    for now and look at page formatting later.
    HPL: Note that Springer fixes all this. They first generate XML, then
    new latex with their special style. They can't use the authors' PDF
    anymore.
[x] Think about whether to use http or https in references
[x] Check that Docker image stable-py3 is actually available: It's not
[x] How to run spellcheck?
    HPL: I do that automatically (doconce spellcheck - much inspired by
    the fenics book spellchack) for every compile.
[x] Regenerate the plot for first Poisson example on 8 x 8 mesh
[x] Add reference to SIAM News periodic table article in Chapter 1
[x] Inconsistent notation: u_D in math and u_b in code
[x] Small figures, for example 2.4, with difficult to read text.
    HPL: I don't think this one is difficult to read... But we can do frac=1
    and width=700 to blow it up as is.
[x] Check all Navier--Stokes etc
    HPL: This is also something Springer will do, but it's nice with
    ndash in our PDF as well.
[x] Check vtkfile << (u, t) for time-dependent problems
    HPL: Think this is in order.
[x] kappa(x) or q(x) in Section 3.2? Watch out for comment on q in
    sympy code and name clash box.
    HPL: I think it's a good point to have q, which makes a name clash with
    fenics so that we can illustrate that (common) problem. These are one of
    the details that are seldom met in text, but occurs in practice, and
    the closer we get to practice for the reader, the better ;-)
[x] Check all 'variational problem: Find' (not 'find')
    HPL: The most common form in English is not to use capital, but
    there are no strict rules, see https://www.grammarly.com/handbook/mechanics/capitalization/16/capitalization-first-word-after-a-colon-if-it-begi/
[x] Check all eqns (...)--(...)
    HPL: Can make a regex check. Again, Springer will apply their style to
    the latex from XML. As far as I can see from the scripting book (vol II in
    Simula SpringerBrief), they used single dash.
    HPL: BUT we should have in mind that with time we will probably not
    come with a new edition of the tutorial in print, only new editions
    on the web page and everyone will download the PDF and use that one, so
    with time and open access with all rights to the author, the layout of
    the book is our own PDF...
[x] Check all 'Save' vs 'Dump' in code examples
[x] Which equations should be numbered?
    HPL: I use to number all equations that are likely to be referred
    to (orally) with discussing the text.
[x] Always use xrange?
    HPL: It's not a big deal for efficiency in our examples and range is
    Python 3 (no xrange), so I prefer range then.
[x] k0 or k_0? Same for Omega0 in subdomains chapter
    HPL: Maybe underscore is best?
[x] Rename poisson_vc.py to something less cryptic
[x] Clean out files and codes that are not used (move to 'old')
[x] Check demo/documented/eigenvalue, is the name correct?
[x] Replace normalvec by n for consistency
[x] Which code files end up in the top-level src directory?
    This directory needs to be cleaned up (remove old codes).
[x] Divide codes into subdirectories for vol I and vol II
[x] Divide do.txt files into subdirectories for vol I, vol II and unused
[x] poisson_vc.py is 900 lines long! Does it have to be that
    complicated?
