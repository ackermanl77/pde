# PyDEns

**PyDEns** is a framework for solving Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations (ODEs & PDEs) using neural networks. With **PyDEns** one can solve
 - PDEs & ODEs from a large family including [heat-equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation), [poisson equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_equation) and [wave-equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation)
 - parametric families of PDEs
 - PDEs with trainable coefficients.

This page outlines main capabilities of **PyDEns**. To get an in-depth understanding we suggest you to also read [the tutorial](https://github.com/analysiscenter/pydens/blob/master/tutorials/PDE_solving.ipynb).

## Getting started with **PyDEns**: solving common PDEs
Let's solve poisson equation

</p>

using simple feed-forward neural network with `tahn`-activations. The first step is to add a grammar of *tokens* - expressions used for writing down differential equations - to the current namespace:

```python
from pydens import Solver, NumpySampler, add_tokens
import numpy as np

add_tokens()
# we've now got functions like sin, cos, D in our namespace. More on that later!
```

You can now set up a **PyDEns**-model for solving the task at hand using *configuration dictionary*. Note the use of differentiation token `D` and `sin`-token:

```python
pde = {'n_dims': 2,
       'form': lambda u, x, y: D(D(u, x), x) + D(D(u, y), y) - 5 * sin(np.pi * (x + y)),
       'boundary_condition': 1}

body = {'layout': 'fa fa fa f',
        'units': [15, 25, 15, 1],
        'activation': [tf.nn.tanh, tf.nn.tanh, tf.nn.tanh]}

config = {'body': body,
          'pde': pde}

us = NumpySampler('uniform', dim=2) # procedure for sampling points from domain
```

and run the optimization procedure

```python
dg = Solver(config)
dg.fit(batch_size=100, sampler=us, n_iters=1500)
```
in a fraction of second we've got a mesh-free approximation of the solution on **[0, 1]X[0, 1]**-square:

</p>

## Going deeper into **PyDEns**-capabilities
**PyDEns** allows to do much more than just solve common PDEs: it also deals with (i) parametric families of PDEs and (ii) PDEs with trainable coefficients.

### Solving parametric families of PDEs
Consider a *family* of ordinary differential equations

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/analysiscenter/pydens/master/imgs/sinus_eq.png?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle height=40.973825pt/>
</p>

Clearly, the solution is a **sin** wave with a phase parametrized by Ïµ:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/analysiscenter/pydens/master/imgs/sinus_sol_expr.png?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle height=18.973825pt/>
</p>

Solving this problem is just as easy as solving common PDEs. You only need to introduce parameter in the equation, using token `P`:

```python
pde = {'n_dims': 1,
       'form': lambda u, t, e: D(u, t) - P(e) * np.pi * cos(P(e) * np.pi * t),
       'initial_condition': 1}

config = {'pde': pde}
# One for argument, one for parameter
s = NumpySampler('uniform') & NumpySampler('uniform', low=1, high=5)

dg = Solver(config)
dg.fit(batch_size=1000, sampler=s, n_iters=5000)
# solving the whole family takes no more than a couple of seconds!
```

Check out the result:

</p>

### Solving PDEs with trainable coefficients

With **PyDEns** things can get even more interesting! Assume that the *initial state of the system is unknown and yet to be determined*:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/analysiscenter/pydens/master/imgs/sinus_eq_trainable.png?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle height=40.973825pt/>
</p>

Of course, without additional information, [the problem is undefined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_value_problem). To make things better, let's fix the state of the system at some other point:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/analysiscenter/pydens/master/imgs/sinus_eq_middle_fix.png?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle height=18.973825pt/>
</p>

Setting this problem requires a [slightly more complex configuring](https://github.com/analysiscenter/pydens/blob/master/tutorials/PDE_solving.ipynb). Note the use of `V`-token, that stands for trainable variable, in the initial condition of the problem. Also pay attention to `train_steps`-key of the `config`, where *two train steps* are configured: one for better solving the equation and the other for satisfying the additional constraint:

```python
pde = {'n_dims': 1,
       'form': lambda u, t: D(u, t) - 2 * np.pi * cos(2 * np.pi * t),
       'initial_condition': lambda: V(3.0)}

config = {'pde': pde,
          'track': {'u05': lambda u, t: u - 2},
          'train_steps': {'initial_condition_step': {'scope': 'addendums',
                                                     'loss': {'name': 'mse', 'predictions': 'u05'}},
                          'equation_step': {'scope': '-addendums'}}}

s1 = NumpySampler('uniform')
s2 = ConstantSampler(0.5)
```

Model-fitting comes in two parts now: (i) solving the equation and (ii) adjusting initial condition to satisfy the additional constraint:

```python
dg.fit(batch_size=150, sampler=s1, n_iters=2000, train_mode='equation_step')
dg.fit(batch_size=150, sampler=s2, n_iters=2000, train_mode='initial_condition_step')
```

## Installation

First of all, you have to manually install [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip),
as you might need a certain version or a specific build for CPU / GPU.

### Stable python package

With modern [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/)
```
pipenv install pydens
```

With old-fashioned [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
```
pip3 install pydens
```

### Development version

```
pipenv install git+https://github.com/analysiscenter/pydens.git
```

```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/analysiscenter/pydens.git
```

### Installation as a project repository:

Do not forget to use the flag ``--recursive`` to make sure that ``BatchFlow`` submodule is also cloned.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/analysiscenter/pydens.git
```

In this case you need to manually install the dependencies.
